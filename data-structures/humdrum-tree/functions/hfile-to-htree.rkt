#|
    Duplicate data is the result of the file->tree converter,
        which allows data after spine joins to always continue
        in the left branch.
    Duplicate data exists only in the left branch of a parent.
    In the case in which a spine has only been split once,
        there is no duplication.
    In the case in which a spine splits mutliple times, and the
        the spine join is not the last (i.e., it does not reduce
        the number of subspines to one), there is no duplication.
    In the case in which a spine splits multiple times, and the
        the spine join is the last (i.e., it reduces the number
        of subspines to one), there is duplication because the
        lefthand spine in the nested parent will repeat data that
        should only be in the lefthand spine of the topmost
        parent.

    (byrecord->byspine SpineArity)

    If no previous SpineArity has been greater than or equal to
        three, do nothing.
    If a previous SpineArity has been greater than or equal to
        three, and this SpineArity is not three, do nothing.
    If a previous SpineArity has been greater than or equal to
        three, and this SpineArity is one, substitute false for
        the rest of parent-left.
