# Spines
## Definition
A spine is a single column of data in a Humdrum file. A spine does not include
reference records or global comments, but does include token records and local
comments. A spine comprises tokens, or strings of data. These tokens are
separated from each other by tabs, though a token can contain multiple data
that are singly spaced (e.g., the three notes of a triad). Spines are separated
from each other by tabs.

for spine types.

See the [parsers and converters doc](https://github.com/bel28kent/hum-parser/blob/main/docs/parsers-and-converters.md)
for commentary related to parsing and testing.
